while I hop in the DeLorean\nScared to face the world, complacent career student\nSome people graduate, but be still stupid\nThey tell you read this, eat this, don't look around\nJust peep this, preachers, teach us, Jesus\nOkay look up now, they done stoled yo' streetness\nAfter all of that you received this\n\n\nGood morning\n(Hustlers, that's if you're still livin', get on down)\nEvery time
