6035	Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir	33	111
6040	I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and ooh	38	111
6047	Last year shoppin' my demo, I was tryin' to shine	45	111
6052	You niggas wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more	52	111
6060	I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars	58	111
6067	Killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit	65	111
6075	I had my demo with me, you know, like I always do	73	111
6082	(I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper)	81	111
6089	I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample	88	111
6099	And he said, "Tell me what you think of this"	99	111
6107	I was on the train, man, you know	107	111
6116	So I ain't have to deal with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk	116	111
6123	I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, "Heart of the City"	123	111
6137	You know I ain't talkin shit	137	111
6145	And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line	147	111
6152	So, Blueprint, "H to the Izzo," my first hit single	152	111
6157	"Gimme a beat that sound like Jay-Z," You know, they dick riders, whatever	157	111
6171	Dame was like, "Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack"	171	111
6185	Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper	185	111
6195	I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go	195	111
5938	They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)	25	110
5950	I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider	36	110
5960	Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins	46	110
5969	A creative way to rhyme without usin' knives and guns	55	110
5976	You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'	62	110
5983	We ain't lettin' everybody in our family business	69	110
5991	All these fancy things	77	110
5995	All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)	83	110
6002	For making me do this shit, motherfucker	1	111
6011	The all around the world Digital Underground Pac	10	111
6020	My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair	18	111
6027	Till the night I almost killed myself in Lexus	25	111
6036	Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest	34	111
6050	Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams	48	111
6058	Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom	56	111
6062	"Oh my god, is that a black card?"	60	111
6077	Just askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, 'cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with	76	111
6092	So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time and really I just, like bit the drums off "Xxplosive" and put it like with it sped up, sampled	91	111
6100	(Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here)	100	111
6108	So after that I went back home and man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing	108	111
6117	Me and my mother drove to Newark, New Jersey	117	111
6124	And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats	124	111
6128	And Hip Hop said, "Yo play that one beat for him"	128	111
6133	Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, "Yo, what's up I'm Kanye"	133	111
6149	Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips"	146	111
6169	(Y'all niggas is stupid)	165	111
6180	Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it	180	111
6192	That, you know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do	192	111
6199	And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested	199	111
5940	I tell you that all (all the glitter is not gold) my weight in gold (gold is not reality)	27	110
5963	But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed	49	110
5978	Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Sheila always performin'?	64	110
6012	(oooh) All these things (these things)	80	110
6031	Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and (Here's to the Roc)	29	111
6056	But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh	50	111
6070	And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them (Here's to Roc-A-Fella)	68	111
6085	I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also	83	111
6096	And that day, I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, "Oh you a real soulful dude"	96	111
6113	And I got evicted at the same time	113	111
6126	But then Jay walked in, I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on	126	111
6141	I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story	141	111
6162	Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels, Jessica Rivera, man	162	111
6168	He wanted to sign me really bad	169	111
6175	So I played, actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it	175	111
6184	(It's actually kinda hot)	184	111
6191	Actually, even with that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H	191	111
6198	(Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal)	198	111
5944	And this is for everybody standin' with us	30	110
5945	Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture	31	110
5946	Abby, remember when they ain't believe in me?	32	110
5952	Grandma, get 'em shook up	38	110
5953	Aw naw, don't open the photo book up	39	110

5956	You know that one auntie, you don't mean to be rude	42	110
5957	But every holiday nobody eatin' her food	43	110
5965	Let the sun come out and all the children say	51	110
5966	Rain, rain, rain go away	52	110
5971	And keep your face to the risin' sun	57	110
5973	And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family dog	59	110
5974	I feel like one day you'll understand me dog	60	110
5980	Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion	66	110
5981	And drink some wine like Communion	67	110
5985	They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)	71	110
5988	They don't mean a thing, a thing	74	110
5989	And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)	75	110
5996	All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)	84	110

6030	And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them (Here's to Roc-A-Fella)	28	111
6034	Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir	32	111
6039	Call him Kwali or Kweli, I put him on songs with Jay-Z	37	111
6041	It come out sweeter than old Sadie	39	111

6048	Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme	46	111
6051	So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more	51	111
6053	You can't say shit to Kanye West no more	53	111
6065	Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell	63	111
6066	Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to	64	111
6071	Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and (Here's to the Roc)	69	111
6073	So get your ass up off the wall, all	71	111
6074	So this A&R over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop picked the "Truth" beat for Beanie and I was in the session with him	72	111
6080	(Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap)	79	111
6081	I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper and a producer	80	111
6086	People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game	84	111
6088	So you know, after they picked that Truth beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that	86	111
6094	And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on the Dynasty album	93	111
6095	I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound and you know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management	94	111
6097	(Oh you a real soulful dude, man)	97	111
6103	So he asked me, "What you think of it?"	103	111
6105	And I was like, "Man that shit tight"	105	111
6111	But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company	111	111
6112	So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company	112	111
6114	So I went down and tracked the beats from him	114	111
6121	(Kanye, baby, we're here)	121	111
6125	And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did "Nothing Like It" already at that time	125	111
6127	I remember it like, like it was yesterday	127	111
6129	So I played "Heart of the City" and really I made "Heart of the City," I really wanted to give that beat to DMX	129	111
6132	Two days later, I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame	132	111
6135	"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to beats G"	135	111
6138	I'm like, "Oh shit"	138	111
6140	So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days	140	111
6146	(That, that was cool, that was hot)	149	111
6148	But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response, he said, "Man, that was tight"	148	111
6151	I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, "Yo Jay I could rap"	144	111
6154	Because, you know, of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him	154	111
6156	And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats	156	111
6158	So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll	158	111
6164	I'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up	164	111
6165	Let's just say I didn't get my deal	166	111
6170	(We gonna change the game, buddy)	170	111
6172	(You gotta make sure it's not wack)	172	111
6176	So, it's called "Wow"	176	111
6179	You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow," like the chorus went	179	111
6181	So I play that song for him, and he's like, "Oh shit"	181	111
6188	(You don't wanna catch a brick)	188	111
6190	I told Hip Hop and Hip Hop was all, "Oh, word?"	190	111
6197	Capitol pulled on the deal"	197	111
5947	Now she like, "See, that's my cousin on TV"	33	110
5959	Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins	45	110
5968	I woke up early this mornin' with a new state of mind	54	110
5984	(all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)	70	110
5992	I tell you that all (all the glitter is not gold) my weight in gold (gold is not reality)	78	110
5998	All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)	85	110
6007	Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and (Here's to the Roc)	7	111
6017	They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop	15	111
6024	Flow infectious, give me ten seconds	22	111
6033	So get your ass up off the wall	31	111
6038	That'll take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def	36	111
6045	Some say he arrogant, can y'all blame him?	43	111
6055	I rocked twenty thousand people, I was just on tour, nigga	54	111
6063	I turned around and replied, "Why yes	61	111
6078	And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID	77	111
6090	And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me	90	111
6098	And he, uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio, you know how he do it, one take	98	111
6106	You know what I'm sayin', man what I'mma tell him?	106	111
6115	I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out	115	111
6122	You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself	122	111
6134	(Yo, you that kid, Kanye?)	134	111
6139	And all this time, I'm starstruck, man, I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes and they still are, you know	139	111
6153	And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people, my relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper	153	111
6161	You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say "Naw"	161	111
6177	"I go to Jacob with twenty-five thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow	177	111
6193	Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, "Oh he's just a producer rapper" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right	193	111
6200	And I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever	200	111
5948	Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it	34	110
5951	But when we get together be electric slidin'	37	110
5955	But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane	41	110
5964	Rain, rain, rain go away	50	110
5972	All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family dog	58	110
5979	The second she storm out, then he storm in	65	110
5987	(all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)	73	110
5993	All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)	81	110
6001	Yo, fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost	0	111
6006	And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them (Here's to Roc-A-Fella)	6	111
6016	Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top	14	111
6032	This is the last call for alcohol, for the (Mr. Rockefeller)	30	111
6042	Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards	40	111
6049	Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem	47	111
6057	I'm Kan, the Louis Vuitton Don	55	111
6061	I went to the malls and I balled too hard	59	111
6064	But I prefer the term African American Express"	62	111
6072	This is the last call for alcohol, for my niggas (Mr. Rockefeller)	70	111
6079	And No ID told him, "Look man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap"	78	111
6087	If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here	85	111
6101	And I heard it, and I was thinking like, "Man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z"	101	111
6109	You know, I got groups, I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like, poppin' off the way it should have been	109	111
6118	(Come on, let's just go)	118	111
6130	(No I think Jay gon' like this one right here)	130	111
6144	And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people	143	111
6160	Everybody out there listen here, I played them "Jesus Walks" and they didn't sign me	160	111
6167	The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records	168	111
6174	Dame was in the room	174	111
6183	"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot"	183	111
6187	And I'm sure Dame figured, "Like man, if he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know	186	111
6203	So won't you raise your glass, won't you?	203	111
6194	The day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do man, I had picked out clothes	194	111
6201	I went up	201	111
6204	So won't you raise your glass, won't you?	204	111
6206	So won't you raise your glass, won't you?	206	111
5941	Now all I know I know all these things (real is what you live to be)	28	110
5961	Fit three in the bed while six of y'all	47	110
5970	Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God	56	110
5986	They don't mean a thing	72	110
6014	I take my chain, my fifteen seconds of fame	12	111
6023	Would you please stop talking about how my dick head is	21	111
6037	But all they got left is this guy called West	35	111
6054	I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed	49	111
6069	And I am (Here's to the Roc)	67	111
6076	Uh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth	75	111
6084	I'm like "Oh shit"	82	111
6091	I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, "Oh, yo that shit is crazy, Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called the Dynasty"	89	111
6102	I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the in my personal opinion	102	111
6110	One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed	110	111
6119	I hadn't even seen my apartment	119	111
6131	And I played another beat, and I played another beat and I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like, "Ooh"	131	111
6142	The day I did the 'Can't Be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S., he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly	142	111
6150	That was it, you know, I ain't get no deal then, haha	150	111
6163	(Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real)	163	111
6178	I got eleven plaques on my walls right now	178	111
6186	So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like "Yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick"	187	111
6202	I called G, I said, "Man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?"	202	111
5942	Who knew that life would move this fast?	20	110
5962	I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg	48	110
5977	Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman	63	110
5997	Now all I know I know all these things (real is what you live to be)	79	110
6013	The Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer of the Roc	11	111
6022	They say he bougie, he big-headed	20	111
6029	And I am (Here's to the Roc)	27	111
6044	And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye, I'm almost Raymond	42	111
6059	I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards	57	111
6068	Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips	66	111
6083	I play the songs, he's like "Who that spittin'?" I'm like "It's me," he's like "Oh, well okay"	74	111
6093	And now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on "This Can't be Life"	92	111
6104	(So what you think of this?)	104	111
6120	I remember I pulled up, I unpacked all my shit	120	111
6136	(Yo, Jay got classics, G)	136	111
6143	And I spit this rap that said, uh, "I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit	145	111
6147	Okay, fast forward	151	111
6155	Man, yo, I appreciate, I love him for that	155	111
6159	Be like, "Yo but I rap too." Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever	159	111
6166	The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know?	167	111
6173	Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and	173	111
6182	(Oh shit, it's not even wack)	182	111
6189	"You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on"	189	111
6196	And they had Mel call me, they said, "Yo	196	111
6205	So won't you raise your glass, won't you?	205	111
